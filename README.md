**Challenge Questions :** This folder contains the challenge question which you might want to do.

| Challenge | Description |
| :---: | --- |
|1 | Write a Code that accepts String in a format like `"My name is someone"`, then it has to be formatted into `"MyNameIsSomeone"` and then back to original |
|2| Write program that accepts the inversemod of num to inversemodnum  -> num inverse% inversemodnum = ? |
|3 | Write a Code that scrambles the words by following the rules below: <ul><li>Words less than or equal to 3 characters need not be scrambled.</li><li>Don't scramble first and last char, so `Scrambling` can become `Srbmnacilg` or `Srbmnailcg` or `Snmbracilg` , i.e. letters except first and last can be scrambled in any order.</li><li>Punctuation at the end of the word to be maintained as is i.e. `"Surprising,"` could become `"Spsirnirug,"` but not `"Spsirn,irug"`.</li><li>Following punctuation marks are to be supported - comma, question mark, full stop, semicolon, exclamation.</li><li>Do this for a file and maintain sequences of lines.</li></ul>|
|4|Reading from a CSV file and printing all colums as rows.|
|5|Given Strings of code equations like, `"45 >= 67 56==70 30 <= 78"` and output should be binary `"0 0 1"` { input is seprated with space and output should be on new line}|
|6|Write a program that converts text written numbers (Ex: Thirty-One) to its numeric form (Ex: 31) and perform the opposite. Input: 31 Output: (Thirty-One)|
